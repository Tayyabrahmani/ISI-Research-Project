Olfaction is an important sense for insects including Drosophila melanogaster.
There are 66 olfactory receptor protein sequences of Drosophila melanogaster
which are highly diverse. This article introduces a method for clustering these
66 protein sequences based on image based similarity indices using mathematical
morphology. Two different approaches are discussed- one is utilizing naturally
occurring twenty standard amino acids and another is chemical grouping of
amino acids. A metric is defined in order to cluster the pair sequences based
on the similarity index and grouping the sequences into three classes - Highest,
Moderate and Least. OR83b is the distinguished olfactory receptor expressed in
divergent insect population. Our investigation reconrms this quantitatively.
